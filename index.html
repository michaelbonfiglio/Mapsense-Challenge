I kept the side bar and decided to bleed the map as a big background hero for the details to sit on top of. This creates some nice depth for the page, and is more graphic than the alternative design, however it does impede using the map in any meaningful way on this page.</p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-sm-6> <img id=img-version-2 class="img-responsive img-bord" src=images/typography.png> </div> <div class=col-sm-6> <h4>Typography</h4> <p>You’ll notice I decided to use a different typeface for the mock. I did this for a few reason but mostly I thought the design needed more grey-value variation than what Quattrocento Sans could accommodate having only two weights. Changing the typeface is obviously a larger conversation as it brings with it questions of voice and tone and concerns over price. Should that be an option, I think what I’m using here — the typeface <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/national/">National by Klim</a> — would be a good contender, it’s a neutral sans (which tends read as sophisticated) based on the American Gothics from the turn of the century, but retains enough personality quirks to be distinctive especially in heavy weights.</p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-sm-6> <img id=img-version-2 class="img-responsive img-bord" src=images/tables.jpg> </div> <div class=col-sm-6> <h4>Tables</h4> <p>The tables are pretty straightforward, I mostly just tweaked the type styles and spacing. I left it ordered alphabetically, through I wonder if there is an ordering that would be more useful to a user. Perhaps with Schema for example, the type of data would be more helpful than name?</p> <ul> <li>Fixed height and width</li> <li>Stationary header row</li> <li>Scrollable rows</li> <li>Hover highlight</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-sm-3> <img class="img-responsive img-bord" src=images/V1-mobile.png> </div> <div class=col-sm-3> <img class="img-responsive img-bord" src=images/V1-2-mobile-click-through.png> </div> <div class=col-sm-6> <h4>Mobile</h4> <p>I had a few thoughts for mobile that I wanted to share. I think the current page isn’t very mobile-friendly. I’m just guessing but right now how the page functions is you have some kind of ajax running, refreshing the content area of the page when you click on the left navigation. I don’t see a link but I would propose adding one that to the mapCard div that can disappear with a CSS media query. That way for mobile it gets separated it into two pages, the first being just My data section, where you can click to individual map set pages.</p> <p>I also gave thought to how the tables might look or function on a mobile screen, since they hold a fair amount of data. Through some research I found a plugin to allow users to toggle on and off columns which keeps them at a managable size. Take a look <a href=https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw>here</a>.</p> </div> <div class=col-sm-3> <img class="img-responsive img-bord marg-top" src=images/V1-2-mobile-toggle.jpg> </div> </div> <div class=footer> <p>Made with ♥ by Michael</p> </div> </div>  <script>
